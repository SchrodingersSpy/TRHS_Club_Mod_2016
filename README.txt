I'll update this later. Hopefully it goes through.

REMEMBER TO USE YOUR OWN BRANCH CODE. IT SHOULD BE YOUR INITIALS.
IF YOU DON’T IT WILL BREAK THE CODE AND THAT WILL MAKE ME UNHAPPY.
THE BRANCH CODE KEEPS YOU FROM OVERWRITING EVERYONE ELSES STUFF.
IF YOU DON’T USE IT, IT DELETES EVERYONE ELSES WORK.
KEEP YOUR OWN CODE BACKED UP AFTER YOU COMMIT SO THAT IT DOESN’T GET DELETED IF SOMEONE MESSES UP.

OPEN TERMINAL. DO:

cd Desktop

git init

git clone <URL> --branch <BranchCode>

WORK ON YOUR CODE AND DO WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO TO IT. WHEN FINISHED, LEAVE THE FOLDER ON YOUR DESKTOP. BACK IT UP TO YOUR SERVER IN CASE SOMETHING HAPPENS. WHEN READY TO SEND IT UP, DO:

cd Desktop

cd TRHS_Club_Mod_2016

git add .

git commit -m “CommitName”

git push origin <BranchName>
